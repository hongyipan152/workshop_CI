# CI & Secure Software Engineering Lab

This repository is used to explore continuous integration, matrix builds, and secure software engineering practices using GitHub Actions. Students will build a CI workflow, add security checks, harden the pipeline, and complete a threat model.

## Lab Tasks
1. Create your first CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. Add build and test steps.
3. Introduce matrix builds (e.g., Node 16, 18, 20).
4. Add dependency and static analysis scanning.
5. Harden the workflow using permissions and action pinning.
6. Complete the threat model in `threat-model.md`.

## Requirements
- GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript
- Ability to run `npm install` and `npm test` locally (optional)
